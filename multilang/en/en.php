                        Currently being developed in Kyrgyzstan 8 indigenous deposits of gold (Kumtor, Makmal, Solton-Sary, Terekkan, Ishtamberdy, Jamgyr, Karakazyk and Levoberezhnoe), the total reserves of which are estimated at 131.9 tons. At the same time high in gold production in the country amounted to 26.9 tons in 2008. Due to the attraction of additional investments of gold production can grow up to 40 tons, and under favorable circumstances - up to 60 tons per year. Gold mining can provide jobs to 18 thousand people.

$LANG['ntema2'] = 'How to ensure the energy security of Kyrgyzstan';
$LANG['ncontent2']  = '<p>The energy sector is one of the priorities of the Kyrgyz economy. And without the development of the industry it is impossible successfully develop economy as a whole. Electricity is a significant component of the economy. Currently, Central Asian the countries (Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan) produce about 125 billion kWh of electricity per year.
</p>
<p>
As part of the unified energy system of the former Soviet Union republics, the power system of Kyrgyzstan took a peak character. If the power generation was the primary function of the stations, the land reclamation was the main feature. Total power production amounted to 14 billion kWh; however, a constant supply of this volume is not required. Discharge of water and generation of energy were necessary primarily to control the frequency in the unified energy system and ensure their stability, in addition to basic consumption.
</p>
<p>
The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in a division of the power system. This separation has resulted in the generation of electrical energy has become not only the primary but also the main function. However, because the main consumption of energy is heat consumption, lack of fuel capacity and infrastructure for the generation, transmission and distribution of heat energy was covered by electricity. In the technological aspect that has led to the fact that distribution networks are designed to supply energy for lighting, began to carry load and for heating. This has caused serious renovation networks in the field, close to the points of consumption of energy.
The development of the hydropower potential of Kyrgyzstan is about 142 billion kWh. Electricity is the main strategy of the program of development of the republics energy sector. Only on the Naryn River and its tributaries, it is opportunity to build 22 hydropower plants with an annual power generation of more than 30 billion kWh.1H. Today country uses no more than 10% of our water resources.
</p>
<p>
A significant part of the unused hydro power potential is presented in the form of mini and micro hydro power plants that can be successfully use to serve local markets. The assessment of the total technically possible for development of the energy potential of small energy amounts to 5-8 billion kWh of electricity per year.
</p>
<p>
Hydropower - is both strong and weak point of Energy of Kyrgyzstan. Strong because hydropower does not pollute the environment and the cost of electricity significantly lower than other renewable sources. Weak, as in years of water shortage needs to be supported by other more costly sources of energy.
</p>
<p>
Given the availability of a natural resource, the Kyrgyz Republic needs to fossil fuels from two countries, downstream, to meet peak electricity consumption in winter (including heating needs).
Today, when the task was to increase the industrial component of Kyrgyzstans economy, the power industry already has the necessary capacity to undertake this task. Thus, it can be a deterrent to the achievement of sustainable 8-9% economic growth, which decides policy objectives of preserving the competitiveness of the country, socio-political stability.
Another equally important factor for Kyrgyz electricity is to strengthen the competitiveness of the regional electricity market.
</p>
<p>
The first is regional. Many countries in the region have high rates of economic growth; it is objectively increases in electricity demand. At the same time, we began intensive work on the capacity of electric power capacity in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and China. In this regard, in the long term it creates a tough competition on the foreign markets of electric power supply. Kyrgyzstan should maintain its regional power generation potential.
</p>
<p>
Taking into account that Kyrgyzstan electricity centered on hydropower, the essential factor (generating certain risks) is the regulation of water flows, are used for the needs of neighboring countries agricultural production. This question directly affects the possibility of electricity production.
</p>
<p>
The second — in-country. The growth in electricity consumption in Kyrgyzstan ahead of the commissioning of new facilities, which threatens to transform Kyrgyzstan from the electricity surplus in the power deficient nation.
</p>
<p>
Continuous operation of electric power in the conditions of financial and technological failure with increasing and changing consumption patterns has led to technological wear (over 50%) of the sector components.
</p>
<p>
Large commercial and technical losses limit the possibility of capitalization of electric power, which reduces the possibility of technological upgrading and foreign direct investment for its development.
</p>
<p>
Significant regional unevenness of energy (a difference of more than 2 times), and the dominance of household consumption in underdeveloped service and accounting functions, limits the ability of the economic rationalization of electricity.
</p>
<p>
It should also to take into account the overall economic environment. Kyrgyz energy system operates under tight constraints of resource mobilization opportunities from external sources. The Government fairly rigidly minimizes its external loans, refusing to obtain loans from external commercial sources, and limiting the size of loans received under the small percentage of the multilateral funding sources. Domestic financial markets as the debt markets and equity markets are almost non-functional.
</p>
<p>
In addition, gradually increasing the cost of imported gas, which is a reflection of global trends. The result of the current economic environment is that the industry now has to find their own inner resources required for their work and investments. In other words, strengthening financial discipline, reducing losses and the provision of appropriate tariffs are the only source of income required to meet all major industry financial liabilities - i.e. costs of operation and maintenance costs, debt service, meeting the needs for working capital and capital expenditures.
For the further development of market relations and attraction of investments in the electricity sector adopted: Law of the Kyrgyz Republic "On Amendments and Addenda to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic" On the special status of the cascade of Toktogul hydroelectric power stations and national high-voltage power line "number 100 of 30 July 2007 and the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic "The construction and operation of Kambarata hydroelectric power stations 1 and 2" number 120 of July 31, 2007.
</p>
<p>
Working environment. Performance industry as a whole, in particular, thermal power plants and distribution networks, is too small to overcome the problems caused by its economic position. This is due to the fact that to maintain low tariffs in the past government has considerably reduced maintenance costs and investments, especially in the area of ​​distribution networks. Consequently, to meet the actual level of financial commitment rates should be higher. On the other hand, it allows a significant increase in performance, but it requires a large capital investment, which also requires an increase in tariffs. All aspects of the business remain weak. There are significant problems with the measurement of energy consumption (energy supply without meters, broken meters, manipulation of meter readings, etc.). Of course, the performance of payment of fees and, in particular, cash fees need to be improved, however, by themselves, these improvements will not lead to the satisfaction of the industry all its financial obligations.
</p>
<p>
Social environment. The Kyrgyz Republic, where GDP per capita is about $ 1250, belongs to the category of the poorest countries in the world. Despite what happened in the last few years a significant reduction in poverty, about 2.8 million. People (slightly more than half the total population) continue to be in extreme poverty. However, electricity is available almost all over the country, and in view of the extremely cold weather in winter, the dependence on electricity is quite high - especially in rural areas, where access to other energy resources is limited. As a result of this urgent need and almost universal access to electricity, the electricity tariffs are quite serious socio-political significance.
</p>
<p>
The country has strong regional inequalities in power consumption; the gap between the north and south of the country is more than two times. What lays the social discrimination, social injustice, creating conditions for social and political destabilization of society?
The main objective of the development of the energy sector is to ensure energy security in the long term. Energy security is an important issue. However, after overcoming the economic and social crisis, this problem will remain relevant: firstly, due to the preservation of man-made, natural and some of the economic and social threats to energy security; secondly, because of the (long-term elimination of) a number of imbalances in the energy sector, the expected slow to overcome its low technological level and high energy intensity of the economy.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, despite the weaknesses, hydropower is the main way of generating capacity and an increase in electricity generation. There are already concrete plans for the construction of Kambarata HPP, further development of the Naryn River by building the capacity of Kokomeren and Upper Naryn cascade of hydropower plants, the development of the capacity of the river Sary-Jaz and numerous small rivers. According to the National Energy Programme by 2025 electricity production must be doubled and amount will be increased to 30 billion kWh per year. This will give the opportunity not only to provide electricity to domestic consumption and to attract the strategic energy-intensive industries, such as Ferroalloy or aluminum smelters, but also to supply electricity for export.  For instance, to South Asian countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. These countries, energy markets are of great interest to us, as the annual electricity consumption peak in the accounting for the summer period that is when in Kyrgyzstan there is a surplus.

    <p>With limited natural resources and one-third of the population below the poverty line, the Kyrgyz Republic is working with the World Bank Group (WBG) to improve the national governance system; fight corruption; boost economic growth, public finances, and global competitiveness; as well as improve social conditions. With support from the International Development Association (IDA), the country has maintained macroeconomic stability; rehabilitated roads, the power supply, and irrigation schemes; and improved the learning environment in rural schools and the poor’s access to health services.</p>
    <p>Challenge</p>
    <p>Landlocked and largely mountainous, with a population of nearly 6 million and a GNI per capita of US$1,250 in 2014 (Atlas methodology), the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in the Europe and Central Asia region. Barely 7 percent of the land area is arable; the rest is glaciers, mountains, and pastureland or steppe that supports livestock grazing.</p>
    <p>The country’s natural resources—minerals (mainly gold) and water for hydropower generation—are also limited. The Kyrgyz economy is vulnerable to exogenous shocks, owing to its reliance on one gold mine, Kumtor, which accounts for over 10 percent of GDP, and on workers’ remittances, equivalent to about 30 percent of GDP in 2011–15.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, the country has achieved significant reductions in poverty, but progress has been uneven: poverty declined from 68 percent to 37 percent between 2003 and 2013, with faster poverty reduction between 2003 and 2008 than from 2009 onward.</p>
    <p>According to the National Statistics Committee (NSC), the absolute poverty rate in 2014 was 30.6 percent. Although its economy and society are the most liberal in Central Asia, the country has experienced significant political and social instability since independence in 1991; weak governance and entrenched corruption were major stress factors underlying political and social upheavals in 2005 and 2010.</p>
    <p>In order for the Kyrgyz Republic to realize its growth potential—including to export hydroelectricity as a nexus for regional trade and transport and to promote tourism—economic activities need to be diversified through increased private sector development and improved occupational skills and productivity in the young labor force.</p>
    <p>Above all, dramatic improvements in governance are required, as public trust in government institutions at all levels and private sector confidence have eroded.</p>
    <p>Approach</p>
    <p>The strategic focus of the ongoing WBG program highlighted in the 2013–17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) has been supporting the Kyrgyz Republic’s efforts to improve governance, with particular emphasis on three broad areas of engagement: (i) public administration and public service delivery; (ii) the business and investment climate; and (iii) natural resources and physical infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Support for these areas of engagement has been provided through concessional IDA lending averaging US$55 million annually (supplemented where appropriate by trust fund financing, including the Multi-Donor Health Results Innovation Trust Fund) and intensified analytical and advisory activities that emphasize practical, problem-solving advice.</p>
    <p>A balance between investment and development policy lending has been maintained: in FY2014-2015 approved IDA lending made US$142 million, while development policy financing constituted US$74 million (2:1 ratio). The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has contributed to the CPS program by promoting private sector development through investment and advisory services that encourage diversification and competitiveness.</p>

    <p>454 pasture users unions were established, with increased access to an additional 51,000 hectares of pasture through community investment in bridges, tracks, and watering points.</p>
    <p>Vehicle use of the rehabilitated Osh-Batken-Isfana road increased from 3,046 per day in 2009 to 4,570 in 2014, with a tenfold increase in truck traffic. Travel time has halved, thus improving the access of the population to services and markets.</p>
    <p>World Bank Group Contribution</p>
    <p>Since the Kyrgyz Republic joined the World Bank in 1992, the Bank’s financial assistance has amounted to over US$1.3 billion. Currently, 45 percent of the IDA’s assistance is provided in the form of grants; the other 55 percent are highly concessional credits (IDA Terms: http://ida.worldbank.org/financing/ida-lending-terms).</p>
    <p>Since 1992, 50 IDA-funded investment operations for US$1.1 billion have been completed and closed, and 13 large projects (nine IDA projects and four large stand-alone trust funds, such as from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), Global Partnership for Education, Multi-Donor Health Results Innovation Trust Fund, and Government of Switzerland) for a total of US$217.74 million are ongoing as of April 2016. </p>
    <p>IDA lending in FY14–16 included: (a) three development policy operations totaling US$74 million supporting governance reforms in public administration, public services delivery, anti-corruption and transparency, and the energy sector; and (b) seven investment projects totaling US$166 million in energy, roads, pasture and livestock management, rural infrastructure, and forest management.</p>
<p>The Kyrgyz Republic also benefited from three IDA-funded Central Asia regional projects: Central Asia Road Links Project, Central Asia Hydromet Project and CASA-1000. Programmatic poverty analysis and public expenditure reviews and advisory products on energy tariff regulations and public services standards underpinned this lending program and informed key policy reforms.
    The deployment of Conflict Filter tools to consider social factors because of the ethnic tensions contributed to the post-conflict reconciliation effects of WBG projects. </p>
    <p>Partners</p>
    <p>Donor coordination has been a landmark of the WBG’s ongoing operations in the Kyrgyz Republic to date. Through its convening role, the WBG coordinated policy dialogue with other partners involved in budget support, macro-financial assistance, and structural and sectoral reforms.</p>
    <p>In areas where the Bank Group has a track record of technical quality and leadership, it leveraged substantial donor funds.</p>
    <p>For example, the Bank spearheaded the efforts of seven development partners under the Health and Social Protection Project (SWAp); mobilized a significant amount—equal to two-thirds of IDA’s annual allocation—from GAFSP for the Agricultural Productivity and Nutrition Improvement Project; and raised and administered the funds of three key donors for improving public finance management. </p>
    <p>Although limited, the IDA financing envelope for the Kyrgyz Republic allowed for significant financial leveraging, which has been instrumental in mobilizing much-needed additional resources to supplement the Bank’s investment program, technical assistance, and advisory services.</p>
    <p>Moving Forward</p>
    <p>Over the next several years, the WBG will continue to provide assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic, supporting the Government’s important public investments program and maintaining the CPS focus on governance.</p>
    <p>However, with the deterioration in the external environment and weaker prospects for growth, the WBG aims to focus on helping the country to mitigate the impact of the slowdown on job creation, provide protection to vulnerable populations, and exploit new opportunities for private sector development, while accelerating the pace of structural reforms.</p>
    <p>These adjustments will tilt the Bank’s engagement toward a greater focus on growth and jobs, helping the Kyrgyz Republic take advantage of the opportunities emerging from membership in the Eurasian Economic Union and from improved prospects for broader regional cooperation in Central Asia and addressing the sources of macroeconomic vulnerability.</p>';



$LANG['ntema4'] = 'The mining industry in Kyrgyzstan: Problems and Prospects';
$LANG['ncontent4'] = '
    <p>The dynamic development of the mining sector is a priority of Kyrgyzstan, along with energy; it can be the basis of economic recovery and the countrys integration into the regional and global economy. According to international experts, with a relatively small area and good geological exploration, mineral resource potential of Kyrgyzstan is used poorly.</p>
    <p>According to official data, today in the country on the states balance sheet are deposits of gold (proven reserves of 430 thousand  tons), tin (208 thousand tons), tungsten (144 thousand tons), rare earths (51 thousand tons), aluminum (349 million tons) coal (more than 1 billion tons), antimony (157.5 thousand tons), mercury (40 thousand tons), molybdenum (2358 tons) and several others.</p>
    <p>Investors </p>
    <p>Mining industry is one of the most attractive areas for foreign investors. To date, the biggest investor in the mining industry in Kyrgyzstan is Canada, investments which account for 48% (the "Kumtor"), as the investment put China - 14%, UK - 7%, Germany and Kazakhstan - to 5%, Russia and Switzerland - on 4%, USA - 3%, etc.</p>
    <p>China is showing an increasingly growing interest in the mineral raw material resources of Kyrgyzstan. This is understandable; the most dynamic economy needs raw materials for its industry. In particular, China plans to participate in the development of polymetallic deposits "Kuru-Tegerek and gold Deposit "Ishtamberdy" (southern region of Kyrgyzstan).</p>
    <p>The well-known Chinese company "Hongbo" intends to participate in the development of deposits of rare earth metals. In addition, China is interested in the development of coal deposits "Tegene" reserves, according to the Association of Miners and Geologists of the republic, is 58.5 million tons.</p>
    <p>Russian mining companies are also interested in the development of deposits in the country. On line two intergovernmental requests countries to participate in the concessions already submitted by four companies, including Polyus Gold - the worlds third-largest company developed gold reserves</p>
<p>Turkish businessmen are not left behind and still spring on the Kyrgyz-Turkish Trade and Investment Forum announced their readiness to invest in the mining sector of Kyrgyzstan. From our side it was proposed in the framework of cooperation to create a center for processing gold.
    Businessmen Indonesia are also interested in cooperation with Kyrgyzstan in development of mineral deposits, what at a meeting with First Deputy Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic Joomart Otorbaev said vice-speaker of the House of Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia Muhammad Anis Matta.</p>
    <p>In addition, the development of rare-earth metals deposits interested Japan. Especially for the establishment of mutually beneficial relations in the industry in the republic came delegation, composed of the chief of the department for Russia, Central Asia and the Caucasus Bureau of the Trade Policy of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan Takayoshi Tsuda, deputy head of the department of mineral and natural resources and energy when Ministry of economy, trade and industry of Japan Satoshi Hashimoto. Even distant South Africa is interested in the mineral resources of Kyrgyzstan. At a meeting with Minister of Economy of the KR Temir Sariev, Ambassador of South Africa Shirish Manaklal Sony said that his country has a lot of experience in the technology development of the mining industry, as well as the development of coal deposits, in connection with which South Africa has the ability to attract investment in this industry of Kyrgyzstan.</p>
    <p>Shortcomings and problems</p>
    <p>Despite this increased interest from potential investors, real development is not hampered accumulated over many years of problems. On the shortcomings in this area at an expanded meeting on the problems in this industry reminded the Prime Minister of the Republic Zh.Satybaldiev: "We started to distribute licenses to the right and to the left, so resources are not used properly, because population has lost confidence in us. Despite the availability of resources in recent years has not been created any jobs, taxes that come from the mining sector, account for only 5% of all revenues. In order to develop the mining industry, we have to make productive use of financial resources. We must recognize that there are corrupt schemes in the field, but if we work honestly, investors will come. " </p>
    <p>In turn, the Minister of Economy and Antimonopoly Policy Temir Sariev voiced the main problems of the mining industry of the republic.</p>
    <p>The first problem - poor management in state agencies; presence of incompetent staff in mining, who do not understand properly the field. As a result, break in field work; plans are not coordinated. So, last year the negotiations of mining companies were considered only by 1 June, and in 2012 all documents were signed only on August 1. This is despite the fact that the field season lasts only 4-6 months.</p>
    <p>The second problem - it existed previously opaque licensing system of field development, which gave the opportunity for corruption.</p>
    <p>The third and one of the most pressing issues identified conflicts of mining enterprises with the local population, which is cause to stop work and lose the confidence of investors. According to the Association of Miners and Geologists of Kyrgyzstan, last year recorded 10 facts of aggression against the mining companies. And this figure is less real because not all conflicts are made public.</p>
    <p>The fourth problem, according T.Sariev is the development of deposits in the specially protected areas. In such areas, there is a ban on exploration that hinders the search for new mineral reserves.</p>
    <p>The actual steps</p>
    <p>Leaders of the country understand the importance of this sector for the development of the national economy and take measures for its improvement. On the legal level, the purposeful work on formation of favorable conditions for the activity of the mining companies and the sustainable development of the mining industry. Parliament has passed and the President signed the first package of bills developed by the Ministry of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic with the participation of the business community, which are intended to reform the mining sector. In particular, the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic "On Subsoil"; "On amendments and additions to the Tax Code of the Kyrgyz Republic", "On Making Amendments and Addenda to the Land Code of the Kyrgyz Republic"; "On amendments to the Law" On non-tax payments" were developed. </p>
    <p>To solve the problem of coordination in the Kyrgyz Republic Law "On Subsoil" a norm, called "silence - consent". This means that if within one month from the date of the expulsion of the report there will be no response, we may assume that the documents have been reviewed, the report is approved and you are ready to implement planned activities.</p>
    <p>Also, this law provides for the progressive rate of payment for the retention of the license, which will stimulate the subsurface user to quickly perform all the work, up to industrial development. Now, all licenses will be issued only on the basis of tenders and auctions, which will ensure openness and transparency, and eliminate the corruption schemes.</p>
    <p>To avoid conflicts with the local population in the legislation established a balance of interests of all three stakeholders - the state, the investor and the local community. Now, representatives of the local governments, district administrations will be included in the commission for conducting tenders and auctions for licenses.
